## Testing locally ðŸš€

To run CISO Assistant Enterprise locally in a straightforward way, you can use Docker compose.

1. Make sure you are located in the top-level directory of the repository

2. Launch docker-compose script for prebuilt images:

```sh
./docker-compose.sh -f enterprise/docker-compose.yml
```

_Alternatively_, you can use this variant to build the docker images for your specific architecture:

```sh
./docker-compose-build.sh -f enterprise/docker-compose-build.yml
```
